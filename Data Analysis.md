**2. What is the average order value per customer?**

   We can calculate the total spending for each customer `SUM(TotalUnitCost)`. Then, we take the average of those totals,  `AVG(TotalSpent)`, which gives us the average order value per customer.
```sql
SELECT AVG(TotalSpent) AS AverageOrderValue
FROM (
	SELECT CustomerID, SUM(TotalUnitCost) AS TotalSpent
    FROM `ecommerce-data`
    GROUP BY CustomerID
    ) AS CustomerSpending;
```

**3. How many unique customers are in the dataset?**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalCount
FROM `ecommerce-data`
```

FROM `ecommerce-data`
```
